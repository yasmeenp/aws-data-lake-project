# ðŸš€ AWS Event-Driven ETL Pipeline (S3 â†’ Lambda â†’ Glue â†’ Athena)

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project demonstrates a **real-world, event-driven ETL pipeline** built entirely on AWS.  
When a new CSV file is uploaded to an S3 bucket, a Lambda function automatically triggers an AWS Glue Python Shell job that cleans and transforms the data, writes it back to another S3 bucket, and makes it queryable via AWS Athena.

### **Data Flow**
1. **S3 (Raw Bucket)** â€“ Stores raw CSV uploads  
2. **Lambda** â€“ Automatically triggered on new file uploads  
3. **Glue (Python Shell)** â€“ Processes and transforms the data  
4. **S3 (Processed Bucket)** â€“ Stores transformed output  
5. **Glue Crawler** â€“ Updates schema in Glue Data Catalog  
6. **Athena** â€“ Executes SQL queries on processed data
